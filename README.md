In the 21st Century, communication has been improved from letters and word of mouth to data transmission through text, voice, audio or video across the globe. This has been contributed by the development of telephone and transmission mediums that supports it like radio, wire and optics through which they transmit the data. The world has greatly embraced this technology to the extent that almost every single person has a mobile phone. This development has lead to the development of companies that offer communication support services.
